# Useful Links

## Disclaimer

Knowledge of JavaScript and CSS is more important for front-end or UI roles than back-end. That being said, it's essential to study toy problems, data structures, and algorithms for all roles. The job description or phone screen should indicate how much you will be asked about these topics.

## Other common questions I received

- Tell me about yourself, why did you apply to this company, what do you know about our company...
- What is the most difficult technical challenge you faced?
- Architecture diagram of my projects
- Projects - why did you choose XYZ framework/database/etc?
- DOM manipulation, with or without jQuery


## Other tips

- Apply to as many jobs as possible within the first 2-3 weeks of the job hunt. It makes it easier to handle when you receive coding challenges, interviews, and onsites later on.
- If you are rejecting an offer, put the recruiter in touch with another developer!
- Enthusiasm is key. Showing your passion for the product, tech stack, or the company can go a long way.
- Technical skills are not the only things being assessed in an interview - people will also ask themselves (for a good reason), "Will this person be fun to work with 8-10 hours a day?"
